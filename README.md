# FollowMyFrens #
A dApp built on the MATIC network designed to help you follow your friends transactions for fun and potentially profit!

FollowMyFrens is deployed on Matic's Mumbai Testnet at 0xAAA6a50F8C3Ca38493C05f8cfd1A6d3f63209ac9


### What's The Big Idea (What Makes It Unique) ###
While it's easy enough to look up a wallet on block explorer, they aren't simple to track. Especially not in real time or many at once.

Enter FollowMyFrens ([Demo Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzlZC50X50c "Follow My Frens - Demo Video (Silent)"))

FollowMyFrens allows you to log into your web3 wallet, and load a list of you friends (frens) wallet addresses and be notified in real time as they trade and transact. Give each wallet a nickname and see how easy it becomes to understand who is doing what (no more checking the first 5 and last 5 characters of an address against a mental list).


### How Is This Helpful? ###
Say you know some good traders or have identified the wallet of a whale. Add them to your Fren List and turn on notifications and then you'll see your Fren Feed populate as they make transactions. Some use cases include:

*Case 1: If you notice several of the good traders sending funds to the same contract address, it might be something you should check out. This could potentially put you ahead of the curve and get you into a good trade before it's all over social media.

*Case 2: Maybe there's been a hack and you want to follow the funds. You could add them to your Fren List and watch where the funds go. Bring out your inner detective!


### So, Why Matic? ###
I'm glad you asked!

FollowMyFrens stores your watchlist on chain so you'll never lose it, and has a lot of functionality (delivered and planned) that makes use of smart contracts. Being able to trust the data you recieve, and allowing changes to your settings needs to be safe, reliable, and cheap. This is essential to get the most out of your Fren List, and Matic's Layer 2 solution delivers exactly this.


### Still To Do ###
There are a lot of additions and fixes that can be made as this is only an MVP. I'm excited to develop this more and have a few thoughts already on what could be done, including:
* Batching of customisations (less transactions and waiting time for the user)
* Investigate the potential to add additional chains to watch, and add contract/token naming to further simplify the feed (similiar to the nickname function)
* Unique contracts for each user (allow each user to deploy their own contract that they can choose to share or keep to themselves)
* Updated UI (websites can always be more as aesthetically pleasing)
* Tidy up the code and make it even more readable (again, something that can always be worked on)
* Use the Matic prize bounty (if fortunate enough) to continue to build FollowMyFrens and deploy it on mainnet on a dedicated website
